In this LAC, we will begin to build a dotnet core webapi read more

Read the tutorial at the link above.
In VS Code, build a simple webapi that stores and serves up hotel details (name, website, location, rating, imageurl).
Allow the user to receive a list of all hotels or search for a hotel by name by using HTTP GET requests
Allow the user to add a hotel using an HTTP POST request.
For now, the data must be stored in a static collection inside the application and persistence isn't needed
Good luck
